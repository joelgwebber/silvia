# Christian Nationalism

A political ideology that seeks to merge American identity with Christian identity, advocating that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and should be governed by Christian principles. Christian nationalism is often associated with the national conservatism movement, as articulated by Yoram Hazony. In his rejection of "creedal nationalism," Hazony argues that a nation should be based on shared history, culture, and people rather than abstract values. This challenges the liberal view that America is defined by commitment to principles. 

Hazony's book "The Virtue of Nationalism" provides a theoretical framework for the national conservative movement, influencing figures like JD Vance. Organizations such as the Claremont Institute and events like the National Conservatism Conference play significant roles in promoting this ideology. The interview with Hazony on the Ezra Klein Show sheds light on the intellectual foundations of Christian nationalism and its impact on modern right-wing politics.
