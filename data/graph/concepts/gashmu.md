# Gashmu

A biblical reference from Nehemiah 6:6 used by Doug Wilson as a book title. "Gashmu Saith It" is Wilson's book about building Christian communities despite opposition. The name comes from Gashmu (Geshem), an opponent of Nehemiah who spread rumors to stop the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

## Context

Wilson uses this biblical metaphor to describe his project of rebuilding "the walls of Christendom" - establishing intentional Christian communities despite criticism and opposition from both secular and religious critics.
