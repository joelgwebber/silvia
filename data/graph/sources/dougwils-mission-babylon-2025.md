# A Mission to Babylon (Doug Wilson, 2025)

Doug Wilson's announcement of Christ Church Moscow's plan to establish a church plant in Washington, DC, starting July 13, 2025.

## Key Announcement

Christ Church Moscow and the CREC are planting a church in Washington, DC, using an unusual rotating minister model with weekly fly-ins from various CREC pastors.

## Biblical Metaphors Used

### Two Visions
1. **Nehemiah Model**: Rebuilding the walls of a ruined Jerusalem - representing the task of rebuilding Christendom
2. **Daniel/Babylon Model**: Bringing Babylon into the New Jerusalem - transforming the imperial capital from within

Wilson notes "mission to Babylon" has "a nice ring" and both Nehemiah and Daniel were faithful men.

## Implementation Details

### Rotating Ministers
- [[people/pastor-doug-wilson]] - Lead pastor of Christ Church Moscow
- [[people/joe-rigney]] - CREC minister and Wilson associate
- [[people/jared-longshore]] - CREC minister
- [[people/toby-sumpter]] - CREC minister and Wilson associate
- Other CREC ministers from around the country

### Partner Church
- Christ Reformed Evangelical Church of Annapolis - Working together on the plant

## Significance

This represents Wilson's most direct attempt to establish institutional presence in the nation's capital, moving from influence through individuals to actual church planting. The "mission to Babylon" framing reveals how Wilson sees DC - as both a ruined Jerusalem needing rebuilding and a Babylon to be transformed.

## Literary Reference

Wilson references his book "Gashmu Saith It" about building Christian communities despite opposition (Nehemiah 6:6), showing continuity with his broader community-building project.
