# Behind Trump and Vance Is This Man's Movement (Ezra Klein Show, 2025)

- Rejects the liberal view that America is defined by commitment to principles
- Advocates for nationalism based on shared history, culture, and people

### The Challenge to Liberalism
- Hazony's 2018 book "The Virtue of Nationalism" became a sensation on the right
- Sought to build a right that could withstand challenges from liberals like Obama
- Aimed to reimagine belonging "not around the ideals that won the Civil War but the people who fought it"
