# Donald Trump

Former President Donald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States before being re-elected in 2024. His administration was notable for its connections to influential figures such as Doug Wilson, a key player in conservative politics known for his Christian nationalist and postmillennialist views. Wilson's rise to prominence within the Republican Party showcased the shifting landscape of conservative ideology.

During Trump's tenure, individuals like Edward Coristine and Luke Farritor, who were associated with Elon Musk, played roles in government operations, raising questions about the vetting process for federal employees. The impacts of decisions made during Musk's time in the administration, such as dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, were criticized for their potential negative consequences. These actions highlighted the ongoing influence of Musk's associates even after his departure from the administration.
