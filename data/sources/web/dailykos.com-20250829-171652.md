            Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is interviewed in London on Nov. 26, 2023.
          

One of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency types who burrowed into the Trump administration after [Elon Musk left](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/5/2325968/-Elon-Musk-is-gone-but-Big-Balls-remains-and-we-re-all-paying-for-him) is now the nation’s first “chief design officer.” Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is going to turn your government into the Apple Store. 

No, really. That’s what he said. 

x
*

Gebbia was initially tasked with a “digital design challenge” to revamp the retirement process for the Office of Personnel Management, but now he’s going to bring his big brain to the whole of government. So, he’s spinning up a new temporary agency, the fascist-monikered “National Design Studio,” which is seeking … volunteers? Come work for free for the federal government to help yet another Big Tech billionaire do whatever it is they are doing! What a sales pitch.

*

The alleged tech savant is supposed to unveil some initial results of his redesign of 26,000 websites by July 4, 2026, because of course President Donald Trump has to tie it to his jingoistic fetishizing about the 250th birthday of the country.

Trump’s executive order setting all this stupidity in motion whines about how the nation has “lagged behind in usability and aesthetics” and that he will now “fill the digital potholes across our Nation.” What? 

Meanwhile, the National Design Studio website blares, “The USA stands for freedom, independence, and dreams, yet to those who live here, the government is known for being slow, hard to use, and often stuck in the past.”

This is just the modernized version of the long-held and infinitely discredited conservative belief that the government doesn’t work and would be best run like a business. But even past Republican administrations weren’t this blinkered about it and willing to literally just let CEOs with zero experience in government run the place into the ground. 

**Related | [Elon Musk is gone, but 'Big Balls' remains—and we're all paying for him](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/5/2325968/-Elon-Musk-is-gone-but-Big-Balls-remains-and-we-re-all-paying-for-him)**

All of this high-minded talk about how important it is for people to have better access to government services is really rich coming from an administration that has made the experience of interacting with the government so much harder. 

For example, one of the first tasks Gebbia is assigned: improve the user experience at the Internal Revenue Service. You know what would be a great user experience for most regular folks? DirectFile, the government program that gave people a free, simple way to file their taxes. But the Trump administration killed that so it could keep lining the pockets of the big commercial tax preparation companies who back Trump. 

You know what else would be a great user experience for most regular folks? Short wait times when contacting the IRS. But the agency is now lying about how long taxpayers have to wait to talk to someone, per the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. 

Hmm. Perhaps lying about wait times is an Apple Store Genius Bar policy, and that’s what Gebbia means? Surely letting a billionaire who coughed up a lot of money to weirdo libertarians before swearing fealty to the Trump administration has the best interests of the little people in mind, right?

Besides the fact that Gebbia really only seems to be tasked with papering over what the administration has irretrievably broken, it’s maddening to have to pretend that this notion of using technology to make government run better is something Trump just thought of right off the dome, a genius idea no one else ever had. 

*

And by the way, we already had a whole government agency dedicated to that. Trump shuttered it. 

But where a door closes, a window opens and, in this case apparently, another Trump-loving billionaire just slides on in. So efficient!

I would bet a large sum of money that the redesigns will be completely [Section 508 noncompliant](https://www.section508.gov).  Any digital tool or website produced by the government must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for persons with disabilities.  I bet this guy has never even heard of it.  The US government websites look the way they do BECAUSE of Section 508 guidelines that they be accessible to ALL Americans.

I wanted to renew my passport and went **to the proper State Dept. website.**  As you can see, the font is ridiculously small.  I don’t know if that’s something new or if the site’s been that way for a long time.  An effort to improve it, if it’s *done well*, isn’t a bad thing. Of course there’s no reason to *expect* things to be done well by this administration.

Yeah, because I feel sure that airbnb “hosts” grifters don’t have to provide accessible accommodations, unlike hotels and motels.

Clearly this time around Trump is going for broke, but it won’t be him who goes broke. Heck of a job, MAGA chuds, for thinking this clown deserved a second shot at power.

Maybe he can convince tRump and Russel Vought to reinstate IRS Direct File since it was beautifully designed, had a great user experience, and ran on modern software. 

I just made myself laugh!

I was going to get in your face about how you hadn’t wised up til now but I do realize that there are not good options in all the places people need to be and don’t necessarily suit either what one needs to do or who or what one needs to bring along, so there is indeed all that.

"The government is known for being slow hard to use and often stuck in the past"

Because for the last 50 to 75 years Republicans have said it's a waste of money to fund government in any way similarly to the private sector.

They've starved the government for generations and are now pointing out how skinny it is.

Well they have not starved the “security” services like the Department of War(s), NSA, FBI, ICE, Homeland (in)Security or any of the Merchants of Death ( Fossil fuels, weapons, ammo, etc.).

Those groups now consume most of the Discretionary Budget.

Maybe if the Party had not been underfunding government at all levels for the past 100 years, their software might be up to date.  IRS is so hobbled only people on payroll taxes really need to bother to pay.

I expect it’s a reference to the IRS cuts that mean there won’t be many complex audits carried out going forward, which benefits all the wealthy tax scofflaws with complicated tax returns where you need investigators with deep financial knowledge and plenty of time to comb through the tax returns and figure out the games being played.

Instead the people getting audited will be people whose taxes are pretty simple.

Many years ago, my childcare person asked to be paid in cash because it was hard for her get to the bank every week. OK. Then I got audited and didn't have the checks to show I paid for child care. No, they weren't interested in the fact that I worked full time, or that I  had over a year of past checks cashed by the same person. The government apparently felt that my previously deducted tax money was now due plus interest. I also hadn't asked for a receipt, of course. So young,so trusting.

I, and many others, the low-hanging fruit, always fund the government because the big money requires more time and skill.

This would be the same Airbnb commodifying housing in my Chautauqua Park to the exclusion of owner occupied homes. All those here wishing to live next to a fly by night pop up hotel with no onsite owner supervision raise your hands.

This is happening while we’re criminalizing the homeless as they pay no rent or taxes when they could be enriching parasitic landlords holding their tenants in perpetual debt bondage, also known as slavery. Landlords don’t like me for exposing them. “Parasitic” really triggered them.

You forgot about Medicare and Social Security.

Back in the Golden Days, there was little wait time and knowledgeable and helpful reps. Each time I called (not often) was a pleasant surprise — unlike trying to get customer service at pretty much every company — most especially Apple.

            Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is interviewed in London on Nov. 26, 2023.
          

        
        
          

One of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency types who burrowed into the Trump administration after [Elon Musk left](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/5/2325968/-Elon-Musk-is-gone-but-Big-Balls-remains-and-we-re-all-paying-for-him) is now the nation’s first “chief design officer.” Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia is going to turn your government into the Apple Store. 

No, really. That’s what he said. 

x**

My directive is to update today’s government services to be as satisfying to use as the Apple Store: beautifully designed, great user experience, run on modern software. An experience that projects a level of excellence for our nation, and makes life less complicated for everyday…

— Joe Gebbia (@jgebbia) [August 23, 2025](https://twitter.com/jgebbia/status/1959376025336582241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Gebbia was initially tasked with a “digital design challenge” to revamp the retirement process for the Office of Personnel Management, but now he’s going to bring his big brain to the whole of government. So, he’s spinning up a new temporary agency, the fascist-monikered “National Design Studio,” which is seeking … volunteers? Come work for free for the federal government to help yet another Big Tech billionaire do whatever it is they are doing! What a sales pitch.

The alleged tech savant is supposed to unveil some initial results of his redesign of 26,000 websites by July 4, 2026, because of course President Donald Trump has to tie it to his jingoistic fetishizing about the 250th birthday of the country.

Trump’s executive order setting all this stupidity in motion whines about how the nation has “lagged behind in usability and aesthetics” and that he will now “fill the digital potholes across our Nation.” What? 

Meanwhile, the National Design Studio website blares, “The USA stands for freedom, independence, and dreams, yet to those who live here, the government is known for being slow, hard to use, and often stuck in the past.”

This is just the modernized version of the long-held and infinitely discredited conservative belief that the government doesn’t work and would be best run like a business. But even past Republican administrations weren’t this blinkered about it and willing to literally just let CEOs with zero experience in government run the place into the ground. 

**Related | [Elon Musk is gone, but 'Big Balls' remains—and we're all paying for him](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/5/2325968/-Elon-Musk-is-gone-but-Big-Balls-remains-and-we-re-all-paying-for-him)**

All of this high-minded talk about how important it is for people to have better access to government services is really rich coming from an administration that has made the experience of interacting with the government so much harder. 

For example, one of the first tasks Gebbia is assigned: improve the user experience at the Internal Revenue Service. You know what would be a great user experience for most regular folks? DirectFile, the government program that gave people a free, simple way to file their taxes. But the Trump administration killed that so it could keep lining the pockets of the big commercial tax preparation companies who back Trump. 

You know what else would be a great user experience for most regular folks? Short wait times when contacting the IRS. But the agency is now lying about how long taxpayers have to wait to talk to someone, per the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. 

Hmm. Perhaps lying about wait times is an Apple Store Genius Bar policy, and that’s what Gebbia means? Surely letting a billionaire who coughed up a lot of money to weirdo libertarians before swearing fealty to the Trump administration has the best interests of the little people in mind, right?

Besides the fact that Gebbia really only seems to be tasked with papering over what the administration has irretrievably broken, it’s maddening to have to pretend that this notion of using technology to make government run better is something Trump just thought of right off the dome, a genius idea no one else ever had. 

And by the way, we already had a whole government agency dedicated to that. Trump shuttered it. 

But where a door closes, a window opens and, in this case apparently, another Trump-loving billionaire just slides on in. So efficient!
